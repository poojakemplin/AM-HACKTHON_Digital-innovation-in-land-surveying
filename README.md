###Poject Overview

"Digital Innovation in Land Surveying" is a web-based platform designed to modernize and streamline the process of land surveying using digital tools and interactive maps. Built during the AM Hackathon, this project addresses the challenges faced in traditional land surveying—such as manual data collection, lack of real-time updates, and poor data accessibility—by introducing a smart, user-friendly digital solution.

The platform enables surveyors, village officials, and administrators to:

1.Conduct and manage land surveys online
2.Visualize land data interactively on digital maps
3.Collect and process user feedback and queries
4.Maintain secure user and admin logins
5.Receive real-time updates and notifications
6.Plan for village development using smart, data-driven insights

This innovation aims to assist in effective village development planning by bridging the gap between land data collection, analysis, and actionable insights through a comprehensive digital system.

###Features
1.User & Admin Authentication
Secure login system for both users and administrators
Admin dashboard for managing land survey records, user queries, and updates

2.Interactive Digital Maps
